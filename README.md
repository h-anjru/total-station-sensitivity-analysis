# total-station-sensitivity-analysis
A simple sensitivity analysis of trigonometric leveling with a total station.

## About
This script conducts a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of zenith angle and slope distance on the resulting error in a vertical distance as observed by a total station. There are two functions defined inline that will perform the analysis analytically and via Monte Carlo analysis. At current, the Monte Carlo function is unused.
